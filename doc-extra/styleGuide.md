# HeRCM Code Style Guide

All Python source files should utilize [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). C++ style standards are under consideration. For all source files, no line should exceed 80 characters in length, unless absolutely required for readability or functionality (**NOTE**: PEP8 may throw E501s if you write lines exactly 80 characters long - you may ignore these, as long as your line is no more than 80 characters)
