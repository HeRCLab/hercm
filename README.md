# HeRC Matrix Tools (HeRCM)

# Introduction
**ATTENTION**: This project is still under active development. While most of the code has been tested for basic functionality, performance and edge cases have not been evaluated yet. 

HeRC Matrix Tools is a collection of open source sparse and symmetric matrix tools, originally created for the University of South Carolina HeRC research group. 

HeRC Matrix Tools encompasses a number of tools and libraries to make working with symmetric matrices easier, enumerated below. 

# Documentation

Some special purpose documentation is kept in `doc-extra` in markdown format. All other documentation is generated by Doxygen. Doxygen output is not tracked in git, but compiled copies of said documentation are included with project releases. 

Documentation may be built manually with `doxygen Doxyfile` in the TLD of the project. 

**NOTE**: documentation for C components of the project are not listed in the "class browser" - you must use the "Files" tab, then select the file you wish to view documentation for. 

# Current Features

## Python 3.X
* read/write access to the file formats:
 * mtx
 * bxf
 * valcol
 * mat
* conversion of matrix to/from scipy.sparse and numpy dense matrix formats



# Major Libraries & their Purposes

## Herc Explorer
Wraps most libraries and functionalities provided by the hercm project within a command line interface. Includes the ability to read and write matrices in a variety of formats, preview or plot matrices, and perform a variety of operations on them. 

`src/python33/HercExplorer.py`

## libHercmIO 
Aggregate IO library for hercm python code, wraps code to read and write matrices in all formats support by hercm python code.

`src/python33/libHercmIO.py`

## bxfio
C BXF library. Currently supports read only access to BXF matrix files in C.

`src/c/bxfio.c`

## libBXF
Provides read/write access to bxf format files. 

`src/python33/libBXF.py`

## libValcolIO
Provides read/write access to valcol format files. 

`src/python33/libValcolIO.py`

## libHercMatrix
Provides a feature rich class type for sparse matrices, and includes scipy/numpy interoperability. 

`src/python33/libHercMatrix.py`

## matrixUtils
Provides user-interface centric utilities pertaining to sparse matrices, generally used almost exclusively by MatrixExplorer, but is provided as a separate library to facilitate automation by other scripts and programs. 

`src/python33/MatrixUtils.py`
